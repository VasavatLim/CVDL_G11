# CVDL_BSc

This repo contains everything you need for the Computer Vision with Deep
Learning course in Spring Semester 2025. Be sure to check out the tutorials to
get started.

## Course Description
We discuss the design principles of deep neural network architectures, as well
as development and learning methods, algorithms and paradigms to solve
challenging computer vision tasks. We focus on recent research trends as they
apply to practical applications and tools.

## Lab Sessions
The labs are subject to change until the start of the corresponding Lab (see
table below). They can be handed in latest in the week indicated below
(rightmost column)

> **_NOTE_**
> Be sure to allways pull the latest changes before you start working on the labs.
